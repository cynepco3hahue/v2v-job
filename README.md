# v2v for Kubevirt

A job to allow importing a VM from a support virt-v2v source into KubeVirt.

There are some constraints on the VM:

- Single NIC
- Single attached disk

# Example

> **NOTE:** Even if the `oc` tool is used, the example creates the job on 
> Kubernetes. OpenShift support will follow.

By default an example Fedora image will be converted:

```bash
$ oc process --local -f manifests/template.yaml \
    -p SOURCE_TYPE=libvirt \
    -p SOURCE_URI=qemu+tcp://192.168.1.1/system \
    -p SOURCE_NAME=rhel7 \
  | kubectl create -f -
$ kubectl get jobs
$ kubectl get pods
```

Alternatively the job manifest can be used directly, but you'll need to modify
it in order to adapt it to your environment:

```bash
# Edit manifests/job.yaml
$ kubectl create -f manifests/job.yaml
$ kubectl logs -f v2v-kw443
```

# Design

Pretty straight forward:

1. Run virt-v2v with `-o local` inside a container
2. Create a KubeVirt VM definition from the resulting domxml
3. Create a PVC and attach it to a pod
4. Send the disk to the pod with PVC to populate the PVC, and the VM in the
   cluster
